Project description
-------------------

For this project, I gave myself a time limit of one week and really tried to limit the scope to [scene traversal, level traversal, fixed map generation and a basic combat system]. Its purpose was to try out some ideas I had been working out, specifically hand-rolled state management in the context of gaming. It ended up being more of a short interactive puzzle than a real game since the path is very linear with only limited randomness in the combat system. I took a lot of the lessons I learned from this project and implemented them in [Black Dragon 2](https://github.com/kugyousha/mountain-fortress) which is much bigger in terms of scope.
